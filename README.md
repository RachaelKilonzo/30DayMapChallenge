# 30DayMapChallenge

### During the month of August 2024, the goal is to create 30 different maps. The intention is to concentrate on Sub-Sahara African countries but may extend to other regions.

### Goals and Objectives
- **Raise Awareness:** Highlight the unique features and challenges of Sub-Sahara African countries.
- **Skill Development:** Improve my mapping and data visualization skills through consistent practice.
- **Community Engagement:** Connect with other map enthusiasts and contribute to the global mapping community.

### Tools and Techniques
Throughout this challenge, I will be using a variety of tools and techniques, including:
- **GIS Software:** QGIS, ArcGIS
- **Programming Languages:** Python, R

### Daily Themes
Each day of the challenge will have a specific theme or focus area. Examples of themes include:
- **Day 1:** Sub-Sahara Africa Rivers
- **Day 2:** Kenya's River Basins
- **Day 3:** Air Quality Index for Italy on 03/08/2024

### How to Follow Along
I will be posting daily updates on this repository, showcasing the maps created for each theme. Feel free to follow along, provide feedback, and share your own creations. Let's make mapping a fun and educational experience!
